# vizualize-Task Application with GitHub Login using Clerk, Next.js, and Supabase

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Node.js installed
- Supabase account
- Clerk.dev account

## Step 1: Setting Up Clerk

1. Follow the [Clerk documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started) to create and configure your Clerk application.
2. Set up GitHub as an authentication provider in Clerk.

## Step 2: Integrating Clerk with Next.js

1. Install required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install @next/auth
    ```

2. Create a `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file:

    ```javascript
    import { initAuth } from 'next-auth/react'
    
    initAuth()
    ```

    Customize this file to integrate with Clerk and configure authentication providers.
   
3. Implement GitHub login in your Next.js app. Follow the [Clerk + Next.js guide](https://clerk.com/docs/integrations/frameworks/next).

## Step 3: Connecting Supabase as the Database Provider

1. Set up a Supabase project and obtain API key and URL.
2. Install Supabase JavaScript client:

    ```bash
    npm install @supabase/supabase-js
    ```

3. Initialize Supabase in your app:

    ```javascript
    import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
   
    const supabase = createClient('your-supabase-url', 'your-supabase-api-key')
    ```

    Replace 'your-supabase-url' and 'your-supabase-api-key' with your Supabase project details.
   
4. Use Supabase for data storage in your app. Refer to the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs) for guidance.

## Step 4: Real-Time Challenges

If facing challenges with real-time features:

- Ensure Supabase subscription plan supports real-time.
- Verify Supabase real-time configuration.
- Review real-time implementation in your Next.js app.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've created a vizualize task app with GitHub login using Clerk, Next.js, and Supabase. Refer to respective documentation for support. Share your experience and improvements with the community. Happy coding!
